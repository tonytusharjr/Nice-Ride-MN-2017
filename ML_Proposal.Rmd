## How do you frame your main question as a machine learning problem? 

> The main question for this project is how does a given daily weather scenario affect the bike share use of casual and member riders? Framing this as a machine learning problem involves modeling the relationship between weather and bike riders via historical data in order to apply the modeling toward future weather scenarios of the next riding season.

## Is it a supervised or unsupervised problem? If it is supervised, is it a regression or a classification?

> We will begin under the premise that this problem is supervised and in the form of a regression. It is not likely to be an unsupervised problem as our data set is currently a static pipeline not providing a continual update of new infomration to learn from.

## What are the main features (also called independent variables or predictors) that you'll use?

> The independent variables are the four main daily weather averages: 

> + Temperature
+ Wind Speed
+ Precipitation
+ Humidity

> Additionally there are other independent variables to consider:

> + Fog
+ Thunder
+ Hail

> There is likely to be multicollinearity between our independent variables, statistical tests can help assess this as the severity of interdependency amongst independent variables can diminish modeling ability.

> This is a question that requires additional input...while the time domain of our data set and problem is on a total daily ride count level - we are not working in a time domain of hourly or by the minute - there may or may not be a use for the geospatial variables in the data. Ideally, the density of the geospatial variables would be summarized daily as well and not only would the modeling predict x number of rides for the day but it might also predict a pattern or ranking of ride density for every starting bike station. Will need input on how this might be achieved. This would be a helpful feature in order apply the solution of the problem toward maintenance tasks and other operational objectives for Nice Ride MN.

## Which machine learning technique will you use?

> We will consider several independent weather variables following the linear form of a bike season and use the variables to estimate total daily bike use of casual and member riders. The model will fit the form of a linear regression, but perhaps a clustering component will also be required if the predicted daily bike volume is to ranked by bike station starting points.

## How will you evaluate the success of your machine learning technique? What metric will you use?

> 60-75% of the data set, either the 2016 & 2017 seasons together or separately, will be utilized for training the model and the remaining percentage will be used to test the model. We will utilize a confusion matrix for examining the false positives and negatives in the testing phase. There are several different R packages that offer this ability, which one we utilize is TBD.

## Additional things to consider:

> + Will need to determine how to perform a predictive component of bike station density.
> + Will need to settle on R packages for modeling and validating, updating this ML outline accordingly.
